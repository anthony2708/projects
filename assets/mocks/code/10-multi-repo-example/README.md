# Terraform Muti Repo example

This folder contains a multi repo example of a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) file on AWS (Amazon Web Services).

It shows how to develop (not duplicating code) web server clusters in different environments using a module in another repo in order to use different version of the module in the environments.

The environments are:

* Staging (stage)
* Production (prod)

This is the file layout in this repo:

```bash
live
    ├── global
    │       └── s3/
    │           ├── main.tf
    │           └── (etc)
    │
    ├── stage
    │       ├── services/
    │       │   └── webserver-cluster/
    │       │       ├── main.tf
    │       │       └── (etc)
    │       └── data-stores/
    │           └── mysql/
    │               ├── main.tf
    │               └── (etc)
    │
    └── prod
            ├── services/
            │   └── webserver-cluster/
            │       ├── main.tf
            │       └── (etc)
            └── data-stores/
                └── mysql/
                    ├── main.tf
                    └── (etc)
```

This is the file layout used from another repo:

```bash
modules
    └── services/
        └── webserver-cluster/
            ├── main.tf
            └── (etc)
```

It uses in common for both environments:

* Terraform Remote State example: [live/global/s3](live/global/s3)
* Terraform Web Server Cluster module example in another repo: [https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-aws-repo-examples](https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-aws-repo-examples)

It uses for staging environment:

* Terraform MySQL on RDS example (staging environment): [live/stage/data-stores/mysql](live/stage/data-stores/mysql)
* Terraform Web Server Cluster example (staging environment): [live/stage/services/webserver-cluster](live/stage/services/webserver-cluster)

It uses for production environment:

* Terraform MySQL on RDS example (production environment): [live/prod/data-stores/mysql](live/prod/data-stores/mysql)
* Terraform Web Server Cluster example (production environment): [live/prod/services/webserver-cluster](live/prod/services/webserver-cluster)

## Requirements

* You must have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your computer.
* You must have an [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.
* It uses the Terraform AWS Provider that interacts with the many resources supported by AWS through its APIs.
* This code was written for Terraform 0.10.x.

## Using the code

* Configure your AWS access keys.

  **Important:** For security, it is strongly recommend that you use IAM users instead of the root account for AWS access.

  Setting your credentials for use by Terraform can be done in a number of ways, but here are the recommended approaches:

  * The default credentials file
  
    Set credentials in the AWS credentials profile file on your local system, located at:

    `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix

    `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

    This file should contain lines in the following format:

    ```bash
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your_access_key_id>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_access_key>
    ```
    Substitute your own AWS credentials values for the values `<your_access_key_id>` and `<your_secret_access_key>`.

  * Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  
    Set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

    To set these variables on Linux, macOS, or Unix, use `export`:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key_id>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key>
    ```

    To set these variables on Windows, use `set`:

    ```bash
    set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key_id>
    set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_access_key>
    ```

* Use Terraform Remote State example for creating the remote state bucket. See: [live/global/s3](live/global/s3)

* Use Terraform module example (in another repo) for Web Server Cluster example in the staging environment and Web Server Cluster example in the production environment. See: [https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-aws-repo-examples](https://github.com/alfonsof/terraform-aws-repo-examples)

* Use Terraform MySQL on RDS example for creating a MySQL database in the staging environment. See: [live/stage/data-stores/mysql](live/stage/data-stores/mysql)

* Use Terraform Web Server Cluster example for creating a web server cluster in the staging environment. See: [live/stage/services/webserver-cluster](live/stage/services/webserver-cluster)

* Use Terraform MySQL on RDS example for creating a MySQL database in the production environment. See: [live/prod/data-stores/mysql](live/prod/data-stores/mysql)

* Use Terraform Web Server Cluster example for creating a web server cluster in the production environment. See: [live/prod/services/webserver-cluster](live/prod/services/webserver-cluster)
