# Terraform Web Server Cluster module example

This folder contains a Web Server Cluster module example of a Terraform file [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

This Terraform file define a cluster of web servers module on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using EC2 and Auto Scaling, and a load balancer using ELB.

The cluster of web servers returns "Hello, World" for the URL `/`. The load balancer listens on port 80.

## Requirements

* You must have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your computer.
* You must have an [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](http://aws.amazon.com/) account.
* It uses the Terraform AWS Provider that interacts with the many resources supported by AWS through its APIs.
* This code was written for Terraform 0.10.x.

## Using the code

Terraform modules are not meant to be deployed directly. Instead, you should be using them from other templates. See
[stage/services/webserver-cluster](../../../stage/services-webserver-cluster) and
[prod/services/webserver-cluster](../../../prod/services-webserver-cluster) for examples.
