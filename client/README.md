# React-Template

A repository to help you get started with React and deploy your app to GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

0. Fork this repository.
1. Edit your code in this repository. 
2. (Optional) Add a **CNAME** file into the `public` folder with the custom domain that you have (***if you don't use the GitHub domain***). Your domain should not include `http://` or `https://`, just the domain name inside the CNAME file. Or if you don't use your custom domain, please **DELETE** the CNAME file to avoid conflict with the original domain. 
3. Edit the `homepage` property in `package.json` to match your repository name and your username. E.g. `https://<your-username>.github.io` or `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/` (or your custom domain)
4. Push to Github with `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`.
5. Go to **Settings > Code and Automation > Pages > Source** and change the branch to `gh-pages`.
6. Wait a few minutes and your changes will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`or `https://<your-username>.github.io/` or your custom domain.
7. (Optional) Add HTTPS to your web, if you use the custom domain. Github domain should be served **automatically** with HTTPS.
